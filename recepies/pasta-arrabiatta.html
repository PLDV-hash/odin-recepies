    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One day, my girlfriend and I sat in front of the open fridge and wandered "What can we eat with a can of tomatoes, garlic and some pasta ?</p>
    <p>Some say that "creativity comes from constraint" and that day we found out that it can't be more true</p>
    <p>Stay hooked to learn this dangerously simple, but delicious recepie that can save you time and money</p>
    
    <h2>Things that you need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomatoes or a can of tomatoes</li>
      <li>7 garlic gloves (yes, you need alot of them)</li>
      <li>Some olive oil</li>
      <li>Pasta (any should do)</li>
      <li>Fresh basel</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley</li>
      <li>Some cayenne powder or a hot pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Add some olive oil to the pan and let it heat up</li>
      <li>Chop the garlic and add it to the pan</li>
      <li>Let it cook for a while until you see some browning of the garlic</li>
      <li>Add the tomatoes to the mix (be careful here because the water of the tomatoes doesn't mix well with the hot oil and it will scisel violently)</li>
      <li>Season and reduce the heat of the sauce to a gentle simmer</li>
      <li>Cook the pasta as shown on the packaging</li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The beauty of this recepie is that you can go in many ways to make it your own</p>
